# Portfolio - Rik Jansen
Below is a short summary of a variety of projects, both personal and in groups, I have worked on over the past few years.
Unfortunately, because I haven’t maintained the servers involved, none of the software projects mentioned below are still functioning.

## Software Engineering

### Greenhouse Generative AI Project (in progress)
A project that aims to use AI generated art and music to empower and inspire Greenhouse employees to be more productive and creative.
My current focus is on interaction design, user testing, and technical aspects of generative AI.

### Filmer
An application that gives you an endless list of recommendations for movies you might like based on your preferences, and allows you to maintain a watchlist. 
This project was mostly focused on technical challenges, creating a full-stack application with a frontend (application, login screen, etc) using React, backend (algorithm) using C#, and SQL database using Entity Framework Core, with a focus on maintainability, security, and performance. It's a project I'm quite happy with - although it's not much to look at visually, it is a complete full-stack app that I created on my own, which was a very valuable learning experience.

### Eeventify
A social media app that allows you to create location-based events that can be found and joined by people with similar interests to yours - i.e., having a study session at your local university or organising a hockey match at a nearby park.
A full-stack application which, aside from the technological challenges, our project group used as a vehicle to study and experiment with microservices, app design, and user experience design.

### Rockstars Quiz App
An assignment from Team Rockstars IT to make an internal app for employees to play a quizzing game, similar to applications like Kahoot.
Focus on mobile app development, UI design, and instantaneous communication between multiple devices.

### Concert Finder
A web application that allows a user to link their Spotify account and be shown a list of local concerts by artists they listen to and save them to their account.
For this project the main challenge was building and accessing different APIs and integrating them into a functioning app.

## Media Design

### A.L.N.D.
An investigation into ’marketing’ a largely useless invention in a satirical manner, through a poster, presentation, and product demo. 
While the project isn’t intended to be taken seriously, and the stylistic choices are purposefully ‘ugly’ to harken back to a 80s telecommerce aesthetic, I did attempt to approach it as I would a real marketing campaign. This was my first foray into this field, but I really enjoyed the challenge and am excited to branch out further.

## Personal

### Comic Book Covers
Because I’m still very much a beginning artist, I started a project where I create the cover of an issue of a fictional comic book series every week. My main intent with the project was to challenge myself to experiment with different artstyles, practice with composition, as well as story-telling and conveying information on a limited canvas. It's a very engaging way to challenge myself to become a better artist.
